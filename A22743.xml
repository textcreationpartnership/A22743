            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>We haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, that the Church and the State are ſo neerely vnited and knit together, that though they may ſeeme two Bodies, yet indeed in ſome relation they may bee accounted but as one, in as much as they both are made vp of the ſame men, which are differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced onely in relations to Spirituall or
<pb facs="tcp:29280:3"/>Ciuill ends. This neereneſſe makes the Church call in the helpe of the State, to ſuccour and ſupport her, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhee is preſſed beyond her ſtrength. And the ſame neereneſſe makes the State call in for the ſeruice of the Church, both to teach that duety which her members know not, and to exhort them to, and encourage them, in that duety which they knowe. It is not long ſince Wee ordered the State to ſerue the Church, and by a timely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation ſetled the peace of it. And now the State lookes for the like aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Church, that She, and all her Miniſters, may ſerue God and Vs, by preaching peace and vnity at home, that it may bee the better able to reſiſt forraine force vniting and multiplying againſt it. And to the end that they, to whom Wee haue committed the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the Church vnder Vs, may be the better able to diſpoſe of the preſent occaſions, Wee haue, with the aduice of Our Counſell, thought fit to ſend vnto you theſe inſtructions fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
<pb facs="tcp:29280:3"/>to be ſent by you to the Biſhops of your Prouince, &amp; ſuch other, Whom it may concerne, and by them and their Officers directed to all the Miniſters throughout the ſeuerall Dioceſſes, that according to theſe punctually they may inſtruct and exhort the people to ſerue God and Vs, and labour by their prayers to diuert the dangers which hang ouer Vs. The danger in which We are at this time is great. It is increaſed by the late blow giuen Our good Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, the King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> who is the chiefe perſon in thoſe parts, that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſpreading forces of <hi>Spaine.</hi> If hee cannot ſubſiſt, there is little or nothing left to hinder the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> from being Lord and Maſter of <hi>Germany:</hi> And that is a large and mighty Terito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and ſuch, as ſhould it bee gotten, would make an open way for <hi>Spaine,</hi> to doe what they pleaſed in all the Weſt part of Chriſtendome. For beſides the great ſtrength which <hi>Germany</hi> once poſſeſſed would bring to them, which are too ſtrong already, you are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb facs="tcp:29280:4"/>firſt, how it will enable them by Land, in that it will ioyne all, or the moſt part of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Territories, and bee a meanes for him ſafely and ſpeedily to drawe downe forces againſt any other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that ſhall ſtand in his way. Nor can it bee thought the Low Countreys can hold out longer againſt him, if hee once become Lord of the vpper parts. And ſecondly, you are to weigh, how it will aduantage him by Sea, and make him ſtrong againſt Vs in Our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which is of eaſie apprehenſion to all men. And beſides, if hee once get <hi>Germany,</hi> hee will bee able, though hee had no gold from <hi>India,</hi> to ſupply the neceſſitie of thoſe warres, and to hinder all Trade and Traffique, of the greateſt Staple Commodities of this Kingdome, Cloth and Wooll, and ſo make them of little or no value. You are to knowe therefore, that to preuent this, is the preſent care of the King and State, and there is no probable way left, but by ſending forces and other ſupplies, to the
<pb facs="tcp:29280:4"/>ſaid King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> Our deare Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, to enable him to keepe the Field, that Our enemies bee not Maſters of all on the ſuddaine. You are further to take notice, how both We, and this whole State, ſtand bound in honour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to ſupply the preſent neceſſity of the King of <hi>Denmarke.</hi> For this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell is more neerely Ours, the recouery of the ancient inheritance of Our deare Siſter, and her Children. The King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> ſtands not ſo neere in blood vnto her as We doe. Yet for her and Our ſakes, that braue and valiant King hath aduentured into the field, and in that engagement hath not onely hazarded his Perſon; but, as things goe now, it may turne to ſome danger to his owne Kingdome and Poſteritie, ſhould hee not receiue ayde and ſuccour from Vs without delay: Which, ſhould it happen (as God forbid) will bee one of the greateſt diſhonours that euer this kingdome was ſtained withall. Nor is danger and diſhonour all the miſchiefe that is like to follow this diſaſter: For
<pb facs="tcp:29280:5"/>if hee bee not preſently releeued, the cauſe of Religion is not onely likely to ſuffer by it in ſome one part, (as it hath already in a fearefull manner in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate</hi>) but in all places, where it hath gotten any footing: So that if we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply not preſently Our Allyes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates in this caſe, it is like to prooue the extirpation of true Religion, and the replanting of Romiſh Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all the neighbouring parts of Chriſtendome. And the coldneſſe of this State ſhall ſuffer in all places, as the betrayer of that Religion elſewhere, which it profeſſeth and honoureth at home, which will be an imputation ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to bee waſhed off. And God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid this State ſhould ſuffer vnder it. Neither may you forget rightly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the people committed to your charge, that this Warre, which now growes full of danger, was not entred vpon raſhly, and without aduiſe; but you are to acquaint them, that all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Treaties by a peaceable way, were in the latter end of our deere Father of
<pb facs="tcp:29280:5"/>euer bleſſed memory, diſſolued as fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and vnfit to be longer held on foot. And this by the Counſell of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament then ſitting; ſo thoſe two great and honourable Bodies of the Peeres and People, repreſented in Parliament, led on this Counſell and courſe to a warre with <hi>Spaine.</hi> To ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this, they deſired our ayde and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and vſed vs to worke our ſayd deere Father to entertaine this courſe. This vpon their perſwaſions, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of all aſſiſtance and ſupply, wee readily vndertooke, and effected, and cannot now be left in that buſineſſe but with the ſinne and ſhame of all men. Sinne, becauſe ayde and ſupply for the defence of the Kingdome, and the like affaires of State, eſpecially ſuch as are aduiſed and aſſumed by Parliamentary Counſell, are due to the King from his People, by all Law both of God and men: And ſhame, if they forſake the King, while hee purſues their owne counſell, iuſt and honorable and which could not vnder God but haue been ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefull,
<pb facs="tcp:29280:6"/>if it had beene followed and ſupplied in time, as Wee deſired and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for. One thing there is which proues a great hinderance of this State, and not continued amongſt the people without great offence againſt God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment both to Church and State, and our great diſſeruice in this and all other buſineſſe, It is the breach of Vnitie, which is growne too great and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among all ſorts of men. The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of this goes farre: for in all States it hath made way for enemies to enter. We haue by all meanes endeauored Vnion, and require of you to preach it and Charitie, the mother of it, frequently in the eares of the people. We know their loyall hearts, and therefore wonder the more what ſhould cauſe diſtracted affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. If you call vpon them (which is your duetie) wee doubt not but that God will bleſſe them with that loue to himſelfe, to his Church, and their owne preſeruation, which alone will bee able to binde vp the ſcatterings of diuided affections into ſtrength. To this end,
<pb facs="tcp:29280:6"/>you are to lay before them, what miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries home-diuiſions haue brought vpon this and many other Kingdomes, and to exhort all men to embrace it in time. The danger it ſelfe, beſides all other Chriſtian and prudent motiues, is of force enough (where it is duely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) to make men ioyne in all amitie againſt a common, a great, and a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Enemy. And to doe it in time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any ſecret and cunning working of his, may vſe one part in a diuiſion to weaken the other. And in the laſt place (but firſt and laſt and all times to be inſiſted vpon) you are to call vpon God your ſelues, and to incite the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ioyne with you in humble and hearty prayers vnto God, that hee will be pleaſed now, after long affliction of his deare People and Children, to looke in mercy both vpon them and vs, And in particular, for the ſafetie of the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> and that Armie which is left him, that God would bleſſe and proſper him againſt his and our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Thus you are to ſtrengthen the
<pb facs="tcp:29280:7"/>hearts and the hopes of Our loyall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects and People in and vpon God. And whereas the greateſt confidence men haue in God, ariſeth not onely from his promiſes, but from their experience likewiſe of his goodneſſe, you muſt not faile often to recall to the memorie of the People with thankefulneſſe, the late great experience wee haue had of his goodnes toward vs; For the three great and vſuall Iudgements, which he darts downe vpon diſobedient and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull people, are Peſtilence, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and the Sword. The Peſtilence did neuer rage more in this Kingdome then of late, and God was graciouſly pleaſed in Mercie to heare the prayers which were made vnto him, and the ceaſing of the Iudgement was little leſſe then a Miracle. The Famine threatned vs this preſent yeere, and it muſt haue followed, had God rained downe his anger a little longer vpon the fruites of the earth. But vpon our prayers he ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Iudgement, and ſent vs a bleſſed ſeaſon, and a moſt plentifull harueſt.
<pb facs="tcp:29280:7"/>The Sword is the thing which wee are now to looke to, and you muſt call the People to their prayers againe againſt the Enemy, that God will be pleaſed to ſend the like deliuerance from this Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo, that in the ſame Mercie, hee will vouchſafe to ſtrengthen the hands of his People, that he will ſharpen their ſword; but dull and turne the edge of that which is in our enemies hands, that ſo while ſome fight, others may pray for the bleſſing. And you are to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that you faile not to direct and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Our louing People in this and all other neceſſary ſeruices both of God, his Church, and Vs, that We may haue the comfort of Our peoples ſeruice; the State, ſafety; the Church, Religion; and the people, the inioying of all ſuch Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings as follow theſe. And We end with doubling of this care vpon you, and all vnder you in their ſeuerall places.</p>
